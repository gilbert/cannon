# Sample Foundry + Cannon Project

This repository demonstrates best practices for using Cannon with [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry).

You can install Cannon globally with `npm install -g @usecannon/cli` and run commands like those listed in the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file. (In this case, the `package.json` file isn't necessary and you can keep your repository Javascript-free.)

See the [Cannon documentation](https://usecannon.com/docs) for more information on the commands supported by the CLI.
